            Lyrics
Jump da fuck up
Motherfucker you don't understand all my hate
Motherfucker you don't understand all my rage
Motherfucker you don't understand all my pain
Motherfucker you don't understand
You seem to sever all my frequencies
I'm tethered to your energies
And everything turns inside out
I can't be killed but I'm not too proud
Maybe you would like to peek through the curtain
At the same mistake you know you always make
But, all I really want to know is
Are you gonna lay the fuck back down
Or jump da fuck up?
Walking in the streets, I look at all this shit
I'm full of hate, don't fuck with me
Walking in the streets, I look at all this shit
Open up your eyes and fucking see
We've got the tribe against society
We've got to fight the real enemy
Get the fuck up, stand the fuck up, back the fuck up
All this is making things a bit insane
And I don't care who stares or stays
The only thing that matters is
Will you reach out if you can't resist?
Maybe you don't give a shit for the rest of us
But if you do, the time is now, if it ever was
If you're gonna fight, whatcha gonna do?
Jump da fuck up
Motherfucker you don't understand all my hate
Motherfucker you don't understand all my rage
Motherfucker you don't understand all my pain
Motherfucker you don't understand
How dare you single out my honesty
Compare me to your travesties
I only want to see you fight
The darkness you want to live your life by
And if you're gonna quit, I don't give a shit
What the fuck, I'm a Mack truck
Are you gonna give up like a bitch
Or jump the fuck up?
Walking in the streets, I look at all this shit
I'm full of hate, don't fuck with me
Walking in the streets, I look at all this shit
Open up your eyes and fucking see
We've got the tribe against society
We've got to fight the real enemy
Get the fuck up, stand the fuck up, motherfucker
I'm a self-destructive piece of shit
Smear me in, I don't owe you a goddamn thing
This life has never had the swing
I don't want to be immortal or legend or anything
'Cause the longer I'm alive, the better off you'll be
Get ready for epitome, come on and pity me
Will you kill me if I say please?
I'm the same old reasons not to try, what the hell
Beat to death with a shovel and a new smell
Come and get me, mom would never let me do it
I'm ruined, I don't want anything from you
'Cause I've got nothing left to prove, come on
My time, everything feels fine, goodbye
Killing from the inside
        </div>
